Smile and laugh with your child. All family members can \u201ccoo\u201d and copy the child\u2019s sounds.\r\n\r\n> You should see her/him slowly focus on your face and trying to imitate you in return.\r\n\r\n- Help the child follow an object. When the child sees it, move it slowly from one side to another and up and down. \r\n\r\n> You should see the child trying to follow the object with her/his yes. \r\n\r\n- Encourage your child to reach for safe objects you show her/him such as a plastic cup. \r\n\r\n> You should see her/him trying to grab or touch it. \r\n\r\n- You can cut out simple pictures of familiar things, people and animals. Try to get pictures showing lots of different colors, textures, scenes and faces. Talk about the pictures as the baby looks at them.\r\n\r\n> You should observe that your baby is listening to what you tell her/him and willing to participate in her/his own way. He also shows changing facial expressions as you drive her/him through a storybook. You can also invent simple stories out of pictures or photos from magazines.\r\n\r\n- Place your baby on his stomach. Sit near her/him and slowly creep your fingers toward her/him. Then quickly and gently tickle the baby and you can say: \u201chere come my fingers, here they come, closer and closer, they got you\u201d.  To change the game, make your fingers creep slowly quickly, or wait different amounts of time before tickling the baby.\r\n\r\n> You should see the baby show delight by laughing or squalling. \r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n",
