Skin-to-skin contact is also very good and can be done from time to time.\r\n\r\n> You should see your baby\u2019s arms and legs move in disconnected manners. Slowly your baby learns how to control her/his movements. \r\n\r\n- Look into your baby\u2019s eyes, and smile in response to the child\u2019s smiles by watching her/his face. \r\n\r\n> You should see your baby react positively to your facial expressions, movements and gestures. Your baby learns to communicate and you begin to see her/him respond to you, even before birth.\r\n\r\n- Talk to your baby using sweet intonations and \u2018baby talk\u2019. Both the father and the mother should communicate with the newborn. \r\n\r\n> You will notice that she/he can hear and will soon start memorizing and copying your words.\r\n\r\n- You can gently change the sound of your voice by making it slow or quick, high or low, or quiet or loud. \r\n\r\n> You should observe reaction from your baby\u2019s face and body and notice she/he is interacting with you.\r\n\r\n- Place the baby on her/his tummy. Shake a rattle or bell in front of him and slowly lift the rattle just a little and encourage her/him to lift her/his head and shoulder to watch it move.\r\n\r\n> Doing so will help the baby follow the rattle with his eyes, and practice lifting her/his head and shoulders. In the meantime, she/he will listen to the sound the rattle makes. \r\n\r\n- Gently soothe, stroke and hold your child. \r\n\r\n> You will see your baby comforted and happy to be held and cuddled.\r\n\r\n- Do skin to skin contact with your child from time to time. \r\n\r\n> You should feel your baby secure and calm as she/he feels, touch, hear and smells your presence.\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n",
