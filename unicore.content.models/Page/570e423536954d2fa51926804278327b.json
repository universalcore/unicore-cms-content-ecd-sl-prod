You can hang rings of beads and colorful objects, which can whirl above a child\u2019s bed or swing within the range of eyesight.\r\n\r\n- Look at picture books with your baby or several children together and ask simple questions about pictures to help them use or show understanding of words.\r\n\r\n> Your baby will show interest by following the pictures with her/his eyes. She/he will slowly try to memorize them.\r\n\r\n- Respond to your child\u2019s sounds and interests.\r\n\r\n> You will notice an increase of your baby\u2019s confidence and self esteem.\r\n\r\n- Cut out or draw large, bright simple pictures of things that will interest the baby. Paste onto heavy paper. Punch three holes in the side of each page. Tie three or four pages together. Place several books in a basket. Let the baby choose a book. As the baby looks at the books, help her/him turn the pages and talk about the pictures. \r\n\r\n> This should help your baby listen to your talk and memorize things he sees and hear.\r\n\r\n- Put a simple little puppet on your hand and make it talk to the baby. Use a different voice as you make the puppet talk. Have the puppet tell the baby about itself.\r\n\r\n> You will see your baby\u2019s happiness and attention growing.\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n",
