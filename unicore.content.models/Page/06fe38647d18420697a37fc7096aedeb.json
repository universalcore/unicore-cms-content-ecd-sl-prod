They can \u201ccoo\u201d and copy the child\u2019s sounds.\r\n\r\n- Make sure that what the child puts into her/his mouth is clean, not sharp, and is large enough that the child won\u2019t choke on it.\r\n\r\n- Put up different pictures in your room for the baby to look at.\r\n\r\n- Clean, safe, and colourful things from the household, such as a wooden spoon, plastic bowl or cups can be given to the child to reach for and touch.\r\n\r\n- Use toys such as shaker rattle, big ring on a string or any other.\r\n\r\n- Hang rings of beads and colorful objects, which can whirl above a child\u2019s bed or swing within the range of eyesight.\r\n\r\n- Make sure the infant cannot catch and put any small objects into her/his mouth. Make sure not to use things that are poisonous, harmful, or that might get stuck in the child's throat, nose, or ears.\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n",
