Let it dry out well and put 2 or small rocks or other objects inside. Find a stick the size of the whole and glue it to the gourd. \r\n\r\n- To make a bottle rattle: Take a plastic bottle or equivalent receptacle. Insert nuts, stones, colorful strips cut from other plastic bottles. Insert wood stick in the bottle, and warp a ring with strips or cloth.\r\n\r\n- Squeeze toys: Trace and enlarge various patterns on a fabric. Cut out two pieces for each pattern. Sew the edges and stuff with wool, beans or candy wrappers. Sew the ends. You can also cut out the figure of a doll and stuff it.\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n",
