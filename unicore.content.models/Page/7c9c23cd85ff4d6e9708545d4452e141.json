  "content": "TIPS AND TOYS YOU CAN USE FOR 2 YEAR + TODDLERS\r\n\r\n- Make any counting you do with children fun. Sing or chant the numbers. Help them to pat or touch thing as you count them.\r\n\r\n- Try \u2013 with patience \u2013 to answer your child\u2019s many questions.\r\n\r\n- Try not to provide contradictory talks to your child. The more accurate you are in your talking, the clearer your child\u2019s mindset will develop.\r\n\r\n- Remember your child records everything you say. The more you say it, the quickest he will remember what it means.\r\n\r\n- You should always correct your child gently so that she/he does not feel ashamed.\r\nChildren still enjoy playing with simple, homemade toys. They do not need store-bought toys. \r\n\r\n- Children can learn to draw with chalk on a stone or with a stick in the sand.\r\n\r\n- You can make puzzles by cutting magazine or simple pictures into large pieces.\r\n\r\n- Children can learn to match colours, shapes, and sizes with simple objects, such as bottle caps. \r\n\r\n- Seed stacking: Get a wide piece of timber and a stick (the stick should not be sharp or thin). Glue the stick on the board. Collect 5 to 10 seeds of different lengths and sizes. Poke a hole in one end of each seed, and color each differently. \r\n\r\n- Building blocks.\r\n\r\n- Beads and chains: You can make it out of wild fruits and nuts.\r\n\r\nNext article :\r\n\r\n\r\n",
